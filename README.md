# Frontend Refresher

This is a personal project to refresh and augment my frontend skills. My high level goals for this project are to:

- Refresh and update my experience with React, as it has been a couple of years since I worked with it
- Gain experience with libraries for managing side effects like `redux-saga` and `redux-observable`
- Get more exposure to the Reactive programming approach by using `redux-observable`
- Refresh and update my experience with TypeScript

## App

This app is a search frontend to NASA's [GeneLab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeneLab) data. GeneLab is a an open science project for space bioscience research. NASA provides [its own search frontend](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects) to the GeneLab data. This app is a personal project that utilizes the same public [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/); it is not affiliated with NASA.
