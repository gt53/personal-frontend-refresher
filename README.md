# Frontend Refresher

This is a personal project to refresh and augment my frontend skills. My high level goals for this project are to:

- Refresh and update my experience with React, as it has been a couple of years since I worked with it
- Gain experience with libraries for managing side effects like `redux-saga` and `redux-observable`
- Get more exposure to the Reactive programming approach by using `redux-observable`
